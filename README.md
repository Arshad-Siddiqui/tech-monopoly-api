# API for [Monopoly Game](https://github.com/Arshad-Siddiqui/tech-monopoly)

## What the backend should do (I'm aware there are currently like 5 lines of code here...)

- [ ] Allow users to login/register
- [ ] Store settings like custom boards/rules for each user
- [ ] Allow multiplayer with websockets (If websockets aren't the most appropriate way to do this, please let me know!)
